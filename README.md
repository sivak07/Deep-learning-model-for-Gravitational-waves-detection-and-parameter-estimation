# Training a CNN model for detecting and estimating the parameters of simulated Gravitational waves
## This project contains a three modules which are

1) Simulate the gravitational waves and non-gravitational waves with parameters
2) Discrete model to classify the gravitational waves and non-gravotational waves(detection)
3) continuous model to estimate the prameters of the waves(parameter estimation)
